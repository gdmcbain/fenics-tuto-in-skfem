Translation into scikit-fem from FEniCS of
[ft08_navier_stokes_cylinder.py](https://fenicsproject.org/pub/tutorial/python/vol1/ft08_navier_stokes_cylinder.py) as discussed in [‘Test problem 2: Flow past a cylinder’](https://fenicsproject.org/pub/tutorial/html/._ftut1009.html#___sec78).

That seems in turn to have been based on [DFG Benchmark 2D-2](https://www.mathematik.tu-dortmund.de/~featflow/en/benchmarks/cfdbenchmarking/flow/dfg_benchmark2_re100.html).
